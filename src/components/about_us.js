                  <p>Biraja Rout, our founder, founded Bigguys Wingery on the need for a truly specialized Chicken Wing store that offered the finest wings at the best prices and with the most delectable sauces. His ambition was to find “THE BEST WINGS” in terms of size and weight, then pair them with the most popular and innovative sauces. Once this was determined, the goal was to offer this combination at reasonable prices for carryout while also providing a pleasant eat-in experience. <br/><br/>
                     Everything we serve is prepared authentically. Especially our sauces, which are made with the finest ingredients and are exclusive to Bigguys Wingery. After all, it all comes down to the sauce ingredients, which are intended to coat your wings in flavour that you won't find anywhere else.
                     Bigguys Wingery brings people together to enjoy the authentically unique flavour of our chicken wings. It's all about generous portions, bold flavours, warm welcomes, and plenty of room for seconds. Through a culture of energy, emotion, excitement, and enthusiasm, the Bigguys Wingery founder takes pride in serving the highest quality food and providing impeccable services to customers.
